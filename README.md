# Challenge development introduction

### Usage guide
This section will explain in full detail how to run the project and how to use the project

### Development flow log
This section will keep track of the entire development process, how I engaged in the project and what steps I took in order to give a full detailed insight in my development process.

in **project initialisation** are just the simple steps taking on initialising the project requirements for development like: `GitHub`, `JIRA` etc. Just out of the need of being extremely verbose, I decided to incorporate these steps. 

in **JIRA Project issues** are all my `kanban` tasks from my personal JIRA account. Because I am  used working  this way for a couple of years, I keep this habit also for my personal projects because I like to be able to see what I did, what I need to do and what my overal process was in all my development projects to date. Also it keeps me sharp and focussed when working in development teams. 

### Used resources

In here you will be able to find all documentation links, repositories etcetera that I have used during this challenge. This is more or less for myself, but also for the ones that need to review my challenge, as they can exactly see how I engaged and what sources I've used to tackle this assignment.

# Developer side notes 

**9/05/2024** - pre-assignment challenge notes

Currently (at point of writing this README.md) I have not yet received the challenge, however I found an old repository from a different developer, that I am currently using as a reference as it's kind of already clear what the assignment will be. 

However at this time, I am not making false assumptions and are merely developing from that specific repository point of view and will finalize/alter this repository according to the challenge when time arrives.

Recently I had a job interview at Bax-Music and they required me to do a coding challenge incorporating the Rick and Morty API. 

I have decided to start my development career from scratch and open up a new GitHub account to accommodate the new career path. In this new GitHub account I will keep updating my path in the future as I will attend college in September and due to this knowledge I have decided it's time to move to a new account, because it's definitely going to mark a new chapter in my life and ambitions. My old repositories will remain online, more for personal references but the account corresponding to the repositories will be abandoned. 

- Gists
- Personal projects
- Academic assigments

The company is the best of both worlds to me, because I am already a musician and amateur music producer and my other passion is Software- and webdevelopment. I am very enthusiastic to start this new chapter because of this knowledge.
